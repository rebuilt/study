# Beginning Lua

Remember, false and nil are the two false values, and every other value is a true
value. This means that, unlike some other languages, the number 0 and the empty
string are both true.

The simple explanation of and is that it
gives a true result only if both of its operands are true

The and operator: If its first operand is false or nil, then
the first operand is used as the result; otherwise the second operand is used as the result.
