# Methodology
- Data analysis of 23,000 data points from over 2,000 companies of various sizes

# Highest performing companies
- Higher rates of profitability,

- Better customer satisfaction,
- Twice as likely to meet or exceed their organizational performance goals

# Four key metrics
- Change Lead Time
- Deployment Frequency
- Change Failure Rate
- Mean Time to Recovery

# 24 Key capabilities
- Continous Delivery
- Architecture
- Product and Process
- Lean Management and Monitoring
- Cultural

# Continous Delivery
- Use version control for all Production Artifacts
- Automate your deployment process
- Implement continous integration
- Use trunk-base development methods
- Implement test automation
- Support test data management
- Shift left on security
- Implement Continous Delivery 
  
# Architecture
- A Loosly Coupled Architecture
- Architect for Empowered Teams

# Product and Process
- Gather and Implement Customer Feedback
- Make the flow of work visible through the value stream
- Work in small batches
- Foster and enable team experimentation

# Lean management and Monitoring
- Have a lightweight change approval process
- Monitor across Application and Infrastructure to Inform Business Decisions
- Check System Health Proactively
- Improve processes and manage work-in-process limits
- Visualize work to monitor quality and communicate throughout the team

# Cultural

- Provide resources and tools that make work meaningful
- Support or embody Transformational Leadership

# Other interesting findings
- Burnout: poor organizational culture, poor leadership, lack of organizational investment, poor organizational performance, large deployment pain
- 50 % less time fixing security issues
- An experimental approach correlates to continous delivery
