# Methodology
- Data analysis of 23,000 data points from over 2,000 companies of various sizes

# Highest performing companies
- Higher rates of profitability
- Larger market share
- Better customer satisfaction
- Twice as likely to meet or exceed their organizational performance goals

# Find commonalities among the highest performing companies
- Exploratory Data analysis
- Correlations
- Employee surveys - [example survey, pg 8](https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod.tracker2/resource/119281469/bk_acx0_111900.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ASIA3QAARYV2K4X4IRG5%2F20230316%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230316T174105Z&X-Amz-Expires=1800&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEFIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDad95Vz9yC2j4XryCd7d3Q81gUUE5QUBkRO5VNoDZeoQIgBxb1Ca9H%2BuuWNynXsazuwKSI%2B9eCgNwrClJeTNyxnroqmAIIGhAAGgw3OTAyNzUxNDcxMjQiDMuetEUYwBPRTzmMvCr1AaC7RMT3sQHK9JE%2FSq0C88G4t4G%2FMWVOh47UQfyoz7o4ammtMbOrVlFix%2FBZCArKXIyywfz90kreI%2FZmkHuTtkkGM1uceXotv5%2Fy2DDo6oBqRsP4DdNR0EeB2gb3a7a%2BbzNR9baVqych20rXIngJZ9FCRvKTzO02kkBP2zkaEfYXt4FKwytrRIDRZzdWumL5FRBUsy%2FfBMD2QNWIxbpcM6MTsrBT5c4Lf4suvoraSDCzd%2BX9M1C7igP%2BDu5OMrHgp%2F0HbNzpY9XaaIxEQDUHfOwpnvAW5Qn9UKfUq35XI4znCbES8zAAfk0N%2BkJ48PQE%2BK5Rn%2B3xMJyazaAGOp0BeWdzQZ%2B4K1uRk4g5Bf15jrGuaXNFoUdJoSOFWvg%2BXtKpApDUQ1rWL1P8h5AqaO0zjYnMJphCzHlXjJtIgoUacqqP12QyYU0AmN0pXJt9VSPPi39Ff%2BoCjpdRHOX6LNwYm0ZkhlSdC0pyoEwRcg2uNW%2F4TL%2BtUdVN0IP2jaKbIk2mwSqCYtLvH3%2BKHOJUWyzuOdRwEhToOo1Fd5Pm6w%3D%3D&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5866c31ecbc646548f2c7fad6644f4e1f725d9f05e74285ca51d04dd1f9ebf77)
- Predictive modeling

# Four key metrics
- Change Lead Time
- Deployment Frequency
- Change Failure Rate
- Mean Time to Recovery

# 24 Key capabilities
- Continous Delivery
- Architecture
- Product and Process
- Lean Management and Monitoring
- Cultural - Westrum Organizational Culture

# Continous Delivery
- Use version control for all Production Artifacts: 5
- Automate your deployment process: 5
- Implement continous integration: 5
- Use trunk-base development methods: 5
- Implement test automation: 5
- Support test data management: 5
- Shift left on security: 5
- Implement Continous Delivery: 5

# Shift left on security
Management -> Product -> Development -> QA -> Operations -> Security

Management -> Product -> Security -> Development -> QA -> Operations
  
# Architecture
- A Loosly Coupled Architecture: 2
- Architect for Empowered Teams: 5

# Product and Process
- Gather and Implement Customer Feedback: 3
- Make the flow of work visible through the value stream: 2
- Work in small batches: 5
- Foster and enable team experimentation: 3

# Lean management and Monitoring
- Have a lightweight change approval process: 5
- Monitor across Application and Infrastructure to Inform Business Decisions: 3
- Check System Health Proactively: 1
- Improve processes and manage work-in-process limits: NA
- Visualize work to monitor quality and communicate throughout the team: NA


# Cultural
- Support a generative Culture: 5
- Encourage and Support Learning: 3
- Support and Facilitate Collaboration among teams: NA
- Provide resources and tools that make work meaningful: 5
- Support or embody Transformational Leadership: 

- “Dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men.”
 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

# Transformational leadership
- vision 
- intellectual stimulation
- inspirational communication
- supportive leadership 
- personal recognition.

# Conclusions
- These capabilities are not a checklist to be completed
- Agile means we develop the strategy that works for us - e.g. techtro 
- We are a small team, so we can't do everything
- Focus first on the capabilities that will have the biggest impact on our organization
- Leave as debt the capabilities that will have a smaller impact

# How can we use this information?
- Continuous improvement of our own software development processes

- Take inspiration from the book to deliver something similar to schools
- We have enough data collected to start making general predictions about school quality
- We don't have the expertise in statistics and data science to make science-based predictions
