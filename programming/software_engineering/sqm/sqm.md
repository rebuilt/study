# Single developer
  * The project started out with a single senior developer
  * 2017-2020 working on the code part time
  * He created useful software that schools used to make decisions
  * Interesting experiments were done: twilio
  * Field testing the school quality framework
  * All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

# MCIEA
  * Consortium of districts in the state of Massachusetts

# A company was brought in to modernize the application
  * 50 person company 
  * 10 years of experience
  * Used by 1 in 5 schools
  * $100,000 budget, no working software was delivered

# VMWare
  * CVS, Albertons, Garmin
  * 3 Developers, 1 product manager, 1 designer
  * Dream team
  * Sept 2021 - December 2021
  * React devs
  * Last time they used rails was rails 3
  * Pair programming with experienced developers accellerated my learning.  

# The app
  * Delivered the welcome, overview, and browse
  * Upgraded the application from rails 5.0.1 now the latest version of 7
  * Two apps live in the same codebase

# RPP project
  * The success of the MCIEA project led to a new project with the district of Lowell
  * Multiple surveys per year
  * Early education surveys
  * Modifying language used throughout the framework
  * Additional ways to dissaggregate data

# ECP
  * The ecp continues the work

# Team
  * One Developer
  * One Product Manager

# Rails allows fast prototyping
  * Rails allows us to get a prototype up and running quickly
  * The prototype can be used to get feedback from the client
   
# All the work we didn't do
  * Rails is still slower than a designer
  * Figma
  * Designers are still slower than gathering requirements
  * Miro

# Work in small batches
  * 1 point = 1 day
  * 2 points = a few days
  * 3 points = Stories I say no to
  
# Code quality
  * Write only enough code to complete the story
  * This includes tests
  * Each time I return to a file to modify or add features:
  * If it's hard to reason about, refactor it
  * This is only possible because tests are already written
  * I leave it better than I found it
  * High churn files eventually become better written software
  * Ugly code that never needs to be touched isn't a problem
  * The ultimate goal is working software
   
# Automate as much as possible
  * Enrollment numbers
  * Staffing data
  * Admin data
 
# Github copilot
  * Is there a way to code faster?
  * It makes me faster writing boilerplate code 
  
# Continuous Improvement
  * Retros
  * Speedback
  
# Make space for learning
  * Make time to learn
  * On a small team you have to know a little of everything

# Open source
