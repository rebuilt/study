# Single developer
  * The project started out with a single senior developer
  * 2017-2020 working on the code part time
  * He created useful software that schools used to make decisions
  * Interesting experiments were done: twilio
  * Field testing the school quality framework

# MCIEA
  * Consortium of districts in the state of Massachusetts

# Another company brought in to modernize the application
  * 50 person company 
  * 10 years of experience
  * Used by 1 in 5 schools
  * $100,000 budget, no working software was delivered

# VMWare
  * CVS, Albertons, Garmin
  * 3 Developers, 1 product manager, 1 designer
  * Dream team
  * Sept 2021 - December 2021
  * React devs
  * Last time they used rails was rails 3
  * Pair programming with experienced developers accellerated my learning.  

# The app
  * Delivered the welcome, overview, and browse
  * Upgraded the application from rails 5.0.1 now the latest version of 7
  * Two apps live in the same codebase

# RPP project
  * The success of the MCIEA project led to a new project with the district of Lowell
  * Multiple surveys per year
  * Early education surveys
  * Modifying language used throughout the framework
  * Additional ways to dissaggregate data

# ECP
  * The ecp continues the work

# Team
  * One Developer
  * One Product Manager
   
# Rails allows fast prototyping
  * Rails allows us to get a prototype up and running quickly
  * The prototype can be used to get feedback from the client
  * Rails is still slower than a designer
  * There is no faster code than code you don't have to write
  * Working out the designs allows you skip implementations that were doomed to fail from the start
  * Figma: All the work we didn't do

# Points
  * 1 point = 1 day
  * 2 points = a few days
  * 3 points = Stories I say no to

# Test everything
  * I hate testing but I write them anyway
  * On a team of one the only way to know you've introduced a regression is to write tests
  * It's a million times harder to debug production so be proactive
   
# Github copilot
  * It makes me faster writing boilerplate code 
  
# Code quality
  * Do as little as possible to get the story done
  * If it's hard to reason about, refactor it
  * Leave the code better than you found it
  * The ultimate goal is working software
  
# Automate as much as possible
  * Enrollment numbers
  * Staffing data
  * Admin data
 
# Continuous Improvement
  * We don't have time or manpower to do things inefficiently
  
# Make space for learning
  * Make time to learn
  * On a small team you have to know a little of everything
   
# Open source
# The meetings that work for us
  * stand up
  * weekly goals
  * retros
  * ipm
  * speedback
  

# Four key metrics
  * Change lead time
    * Deployment frequency
    * Change failure rate
    *
